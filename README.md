<h2>Important message from Julien</h2>

<p>It’s time for the famous Simple Shell project. This is one of the most anticipated project and also one that will challenge you a lot about everything you have learn so far:</p>

<ul>
<li>Basics of programming</li>
<li>Basics of C</li>
<li>Basics of thinking like an engineer</li>
<li>Group work</li>
<li>and Learning how to learn</li>
</ul>

<p>I would like to take this moment to remind you about a few important things.</p>

<p>First, remember the framework. If you do not know it by heart already, it is probably a good idea to read it again: <a href="/rltoken/a08_c01OP1XHY3awtkdFRA" title="https://intranet.alxswe.com/concepts/559" target="_blank">https://intranet.alxswe.com/concepts/559</a></p>

<p>Note that there is no point in this framework that says it is ok to look at code from other people. It is not allowed to look at other people’s code, either other students or online articles or videos. At ALX SE we do not copy solutions and we do not look at it when we start a project.</p>

<p>In the context of learning (some of these will no longer be true when you work):</p>

<ul>
<li>NEVER copy any code, never look at solution (and never give any solution to your friends, you are not helping them by doing so)</li>
<li>ALWAYS write code alone from scratch after you get help to check that you have actually understood. If you can not do it, you have not understood enough, and need to study more. Do not rewrite code from memory, but from understanding.</li>
</ul>

<p>I saw some of you sharing resources with each other already. Tutorials on how to do the shell step by step with all the code associated with these, or even video and documents with the solution without even any explanation. This is not the right way to learn. Please do not be tempted by these links. They will only push you to take shortcuts and / or cheat. And trust me, you will be caught. <a href="/rltoken/3nocfYiMMxjbhlMllUqLxg" title="Kimba" target="_blank">Kimba</a> is not a joke and he is here to remind you why you are here.</p>

<p>While we encourage the use of ChatGPT and co in the framework (also, not right away, but at the right step, see framework), it is important to understand that the same rules apply to these AI tools (again, in the context of learning. When you will work it will be completely different, but context matters). At no point does it say that you are allowed to use copilot or ChatGPT to code the solution. If you do, you will get 200% (for a few hours), understand 0, learn 0, and you will be caught for cheating 100%, and then your score for both you and your partner will be 0%. If you don’t get how to use ChatGPT and other AI tools in the context of learning, simply do not use them.</p>

<p>The reality is that at this point of the program, if you have not cheated before, you have everything you need to complete the project with what you have learned + the page “Everything you need to know to start coding your own shell” <a href="/rltoken/e6Nw3W01-33JDxlCyKX-Kw" title="https://intranet.alxswe.com/concepts/64" target="_blank">https://intranet.alxswe.com/concepts/64</a></p>

<p>Actually, you do not even need to open Google once. Focus on your whiteboarding, and everything will fall in place. Remember, at ALX SE you never learn the solution, you learn how to walk toward the solution. You learn to create the tutorial, so if you follow one, you are looking at the solution, you are taking a very serious shortcut that will undermine your learning.</p>

<p>Last thing about the framework. Note that the first thing to do is “0. Read”. Every detail counts. Make sure you read and test everything.</p>

<p>The shell project is a group project. That means you will be paired with someone. You already did this with printf, so please apply everything you have learned from the printf experience here. A quick reminder, that a group project is NOT:</p>

<ul>
<li>I do nothing and cross fingers for my partner to do everything so I can have a good score</li>
<li>I do everything because I am so much better than my partner and I don’t care about them</li>
</ul>

<p>A group project at ALX SE is a project that both of you are responsible for. Everything anyone pushes to Github is the responsibility of both partners. It is not ok to say later “I didn’t cheat it’s my partner I didn’t know they didn’t tell me”.</p>

<p>So you are supposed to work TOGETHER. And you should both understand every single line of code that any of you pushes. Here is a link for you to read about pair programming: <a href="/rltoken/G52zDoV1f2dmmMl3ngchyw" title="https://intranet.alxswe.com/concepts/121" target="_blank">https://intranet.alxswe.com/concepts/121</a></p>

<p>If you plan on not working on the shell project (or if at any point in time you can’t), it is your responsibility to tell both the staff and your partner so that they can find another partner who will work with them asap.</p>

<p>If your group gets caught for plagiarism we will not tolerate “I didn’t do anything, so I should not be flagged”. Yes you should be flagged, because you are someone who doesn’t care about others and thought it was ok to let your partner down and to maybe get the score without doing anything.</p>

<p>The shell is an incredibly cool project. GL HF!</p>

</ul>

<h3>GitHub</h3>

<p>*<em>There should be one project repository per group. If you and your partner have a repository with the same name in both your accounts, you risk a 0% score. Add your partner as a collaborator. *</em></p>

<h2>More Info</h2>

<h3>Output</h3>

<ul>
<li>Unless specified otherwise, your program <strong>must have the exact same output</strong> as <code>sh</code> (<code>/bin/sh</code>) as well as the exact same error output.</li>
<li>The only difference is when you print an error, the name of the program must be equivalent to your <code>argv[0]</code> (See below)</li>
</ul>

<p>Example of error with <code>sh</code>:</p>

<pre><code>$ echo "qwerty" | /bin/sh
/bin/sh: 1: qwerty: not found
$ echo "qwerty" | /bin/../bin/sh
/bin/../bin/sh: 1: qwerty: not found
$
</code></pre>

<p>Same error with your program <code>hsh</code>:</p>

<pre><code>$ echo "qwerty" | ./hsh
./hsh: 1: qwerty: not found
$ echo "qwerty" | ./././hsh
./././hsh: 1: qwerty: not found
$

<h3>Compilation</h3>

<p>Your shell will be compiled this way:</p>

<pre><code>gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 *.c -o hsh
</code></pre>

<h3>Testing</h3>

<p>Your shell should work like this in interactive mode:</p>

<pre><code>$ ./hsh
($) /bin/ls
hsh main.c shell.c
($)
($) exit
$
</code></pre>

<p>But also in non-interactive mode:</p>

<pre><code>$ echo "/bin/ls" | ./hsh
hsh main.c shell.c test_ls_2
$
$ cat test_ls_2
/bin/ls
/bin/ls
$
$ cat test_ls_2 | ./hsh
hsh main.c shell.c test_ls_2
hsh main.c shell.c test_ls_2
$
</code></pre>

<h3>Checks</h3>

<p>The Checker will be released at the end of the project (1-2 days before the deadline). 
We <strong>strongly</strong> encourage the entire class to work together to create a suite of checks covering both regular tests and edge cases for each task. See task <code>8. Test suite</code>.</p>
